      <h2> About </h2>

        <h5> Lore </h5>
        <p>
        In attempt to control the pigeon population, Mad-Scientist and Electrical Engineer, Dr. Pocket,
        created a nano-technology that could be injected into the brain of pigeons.
        The goal of this specialized nano-technology is to hijack the brain of the pigeons so that those hijacked pigeons
        would be able to carry out custom missions related to controlling the overpopulation of pigeons.
        These pigeons are known as Pocket Pigeons!  <br> <br>
        More to come soon... <br> <br><br> <br>
      </p>

        <h5> Tokenomics </h5>
        <p>
          The Pocket Pigeons staking platform for $SEED tokenmoics will be available end of April!
          A large portion of mint sales will reserved for the staking liquidity pool. In order to back it up long term,
          80% of secondary market sales will go back into the liquidity pool! The burning mechanism for $SEED token will
          be announced soon!!!<br> <br>

     <div class="sec2" id="Roadmap">

      <h2> Roadmap </h2>

        <h5> Phase 1: Project Launch </h5>
        <p>
        We will be birthing 3,333 Pocket Pigeons via the Solana Network; upon the mint
        of the pocket pigeons, holders will be given access to utilities. By working
        with our team of marketers and contracted promoters that our community knows
        and loves. Through mainstream marketing, we will be increasing the market demand
        for our beloved pocket pigeons. This alone will benefit the community by raising
        the price of their pigeon if they want to consider resale. However, holders will
        be rewarded with the profits reinvested in phase two. <br> <br>
      </p>

        <h5> Phase 2: Democracy of Reinvestment </h5>
        <p>
        As all of our friendly pocket pigeons get an owner, our team will reach out to
        our newfound community with plans of investing the profits of our pocket pigeons
        into different investments. We will practice a democratic system by allowing all
         members of the community to participate in polls related to where we should invest
         the pooled treasury. <br> <br>
       </p>

        <h5> Phase 3: Return of Investment </h5>
        <p>
        A majority of the profits from phase two will be distributed to current owners
        of the pigeons on a percentage basis of the individual pigeon value. Depending
         on the pigeon's rarity, holders will be airdropped a greater percent of the newfound
         profits.<br> <br>
       </p>


        <h5> Phase 4: Gifts Galore </h5>
        <p>
        Our team envisions phase four as a true celebration of our community and the long-awaited
         announcement of our project. We will reward our community with a giveaway that has no
         limits in scale. We're talking about something that has never been done before, and although
         it's risky, we believe it's worth it.<br> <br>

      <h2> FAQ </h2>

      <h5> What Makes Us Unique? </h5>
      <p>
        What makes Pocket Pigeons unique compared to the rest of the crypto space?
        The Pocket Pigeons project is initially the first community-funded pool
        dedicated with the purpose of being reinvested and redistributed. Every holder
        can stake their Pocket Pigeon and reap the rewards from their holdings. Each Pocket
        Pigeon that is minted is guaranteed a set, direct percent of the Pocket Pigeons investment profits.
        Every holder is entitled to a say in which projects we as a team will reinvest our funds into.
        Pocket Pigeons offer each and every one of our holders a vote in which project we invest in through our
         democratic voting system. All of these special aspects set us apart from the competition. We are an organized
         and highly skilled group of individuals with a like-minded goal, creating the first and foremost best NFT investment
          project to date.<br><br>
